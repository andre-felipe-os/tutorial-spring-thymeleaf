# tutorial-spring-thymeleaf
This project was built following [this tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP7O26fFkjI). It is a simple CRUD of 'employees' using Spring and Thymeleaf. 

It also uses Bootstrap, JQuery and DataTables to style and sort the content of tables. It uses MariaDB to save the data.
